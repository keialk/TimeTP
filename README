TimeTP README

* Prerequisites for TimeTP
0) Python 2.X
1) R packages : Limma, Deseq2
2) Python modules : Numpy (1.6.2 <=), Scipy (0.15.0 <=), NetworkX

* To run TimeTP,
1) Make a configuration file in the TimeTP directory
2) Make a group file, a probe-gene file in the dataset/[your_dataset] directory
3) Copy your expression files (CEL or raw count) in the dataset/[your_dataset] directory
4) Run as './TimeTP [name_of_config_file]'

* How to make a configuration file
Below is the sample configuration file (tab-delimited).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
type	RNA-seq
readType        single-read
dataDir 	MyDataset
outDir  	MyResult
single		0
countFile    	count.txt
groupFile	group.txt
geneConvFile	gene_conv.txt
numTP   	10
species 	hsa
threshold       0.05
maxDelay        1
removeT0        1
FDR     	1
k		20
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) type 	: 'RNA-seq' OR 'Microarray'
2) readType 	: Only for RNA-seq data. 'single-read' OR 'paired-end'
3) dataDir 	: Name of the dataset directory that includes your files (CEL or raw count).
		  The directory should be created inside the 'dataset' directory (see below for directory structure)
4) outDir	: Name of the output directory that results will be saved.
5) single	: '0' for Control-Treatment samples and '1' for single time-series samples.
6) countFile	: Only for RNA-seq data. Name of the raw read count input file.
		  This file should be comma-delimited, with column and row headers.
		  *** Column headers should be matched with sample names in the groupFile.***
		  The number of column headers should be same as the number of samples.
		  *** Row headers should be matched with probe names in the geneConvFile OR should be gene symbols.***
7) groupFile	: Name of the group file.
		  Group file consists of two columns (tab-delimited).
		  * First column - group number.
		  	i) Single time-series samples
				Samples for the first time point : 0
				Samples for the second time point : 1
				...
				Samples for the Nth time point : N-1
			ii) Control-treatment time-series samples
				Control samples for the first time point : 0
				Control samples for the second time point : 1
				...
				Control samples for the Nth time point : N-1
				Treatment samples for the first time point : N
				...
				Treatment samples for the Nth time point : 2N-1
		  * Second column - sample names.
			i) Microarray : same as CEL file names.
			i) RNA-seq    : same as column headers of countFile. 
8) geneConvFile	: Name of the gene conversion file.
		  Gene conversion file consists of two columns (tab-delimited).
		  * First column - Probe name
		  * Second column - Gene symbol (Entrez ID or Official gene symbol)
		  If row headers in countFile are already gene symbols, geneConvFile can be 'NA'.
9) numTP	: The number of time points.
10) species	: Name of the directory that includes additional files for GRN/PPI/Pathway information. 
		  For Homo Sapiens, GRN/PPI/Pathway information is provided in 'hsa' folder.
		  For other species, users can provide their own GRN/PPI/Pathway files. (This will be updated for future versions.)
11) threshold	: Threshold for P-value (Default : 0.05)
12) maxDelay	: Maximum delay of expression propagation (Default : 1)
		  1 implies TimeTP allows expression propagation across one time point or less.
		  It depends on whether time interval between time-series samples are short or long.
13) removeT0	: '1' for removing DEGs found in the first time point and '0' for not removing them.
		  (Default : 0 for single time-series, 1 for control-treatment)
14) FDR		: '1' for using FDR corrected P-value for DEG selection and '0' for not using it. (Default : 1)
15) k		: The maximum number of TFs to find by influence maximization algorithm. (Default: 20)

* Directory structure for TimeTP is as follows :
/TimeTP 
  /dataset
    /MyDataset
  /result
    /MyResult
  /hsa
